# Agora-Implementation


This is a Node.js application that generates tokens for the Agora.io platform. The tokens are used for authenticating users in Agora.io sessions. The app uses the Express.js framework, the cors middleware, and the dotenv module for environment variable management. It also utilizes the Agora-access-token npm package to create tokens.

The application exposes three endpoints:

1. `/ping`: a GET endpoint that returns `{ "message": "pong" }` to test if the server is running.

2. `/rtc/:tokentype/:channel/:uid/:role`: a GET endpoint that generates an RTC token based on the provided parameters. The token type can either be 'userAccount' or 'uid'. The channel is a string, the uid is an integer, and the role can be either 'publisher' or 'audience'. The token is returned as a JSON object `{ "rtcToken": token }`.

3. `/rtm/:uid`: a GET endpoint that generates an RTM token based on the provided user ID. The token is returned as a JSON object `{ "rtmToken": token }`.
